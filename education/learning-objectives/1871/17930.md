# Slide 5

## Step 1

- Say: Here you can see the same counters shown in a hundreds square.  If we have two tenths, how many strips of ten do we have?
- Expected Correct Answer and Reasoning:
  - Correct Answer: 2 strips of ten.

## Step 2

- Say: So we write this as 0.2, showing that we have two groups of ten in the tenths column. If the green counters total is 4 hundredths, how many hundredth squares do I have?
- Expected Correct Answer and Reasoning:
  - Correct Answer: 4 hundred.

## Step 3

- Say: So we write that we have four hundredths in the hundredths column as 0.04. How would you say the the decimal together?
- Expected Correct Answer and Reasoning:
  - Correct Answer: zero point two four
- Feedback and Action Instructions:
  - If the student says zero point twenty-four then explain that we say each place value after the point separately to show how many we have in each position.
