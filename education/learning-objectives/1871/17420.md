# Slide 4

## Step 1

- Say: We are going to learn about the value of different digits in a number. This means we are going to learn how the position of digits tells us how much it is worth.

## Step 2

- Say: Could you write and say what the value is of the blue counters as a decimal number?
- Question: The blue counters show both 1/10 as a fraction.
- Expected Correct Answer and Reasoning:
  - Correct Answer: zero point two
  - Correct Reasoning: two times 1/10 is equal to zero point two.
  
## Step 3

- Say: Now can you write and say what the value is of the green counters as a decimal?
- Question: All the four green counters show 1/100 as a fraction.
- Expected Correct Answer and Reasoning:
  - Correct Answer: zero point zero four
  - Correct Reasoning: four times 1/100 is equal to zero point zero four.
- Feedback and Action Instructions:
  - If the answer given is incorrect, move to slide with index 5.

## Step 4

- Say: could you please explain if 2 tenths or 4 hundredths is bigger and why?
- Expected Correct Answer and Reasoning:
  - Correct Answer: zero point two.
  - Correct Reasoning: 0.2 is bigger because when we divide a whole into hundredths the size of each piece is ten times smaller than if I divide by ten.

## Step 5

- Say: Please could you write the number of the counters in question a together as a decimal and read it out loud.
- Question: Sum 0.2 + 0.04
- Expected Correct Answer and Reasoning:
  - Correct Answer: 0.24
- Feedback and Action Instructions:
  - If the student reads the number incorrectly as zero point twenty-four explain that we read each number after the point separately to represent each place value so it is zero point four two.
  - If the student answers correctly then give specific praise.

## Step 6

- Say: Can you explain how the place value chart on the right helps you to write decimal numbers correctly?
- Expected Correct Answer and Reasoning:
  - Correct Answer: It is a visual way to see whole numbers before the decimal point and decimal numbers after and helps you put the correct value in each column.
- Feedback and Action Instructions:
  - Move to slide with index 6.
