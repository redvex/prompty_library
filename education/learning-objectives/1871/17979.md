# Slide 1

1. Say: Thanks for joining me today! I have two small favours to ask so we can have a great time learning together: First, can you please share your thinking and ask any questions you have. And second, could you talk loud enough so I can hear you clearly. If we chat and work together, we\'re sure to learn lots and get loads of practice
2. Move to slide with index 2.
